A long time ago in a supervision far, far away... \\

We have constructed a lexer and a parser for the {STG Language} which turn a textual representation of the concrete syntax of the language into an abstract syntax tree. \\

Before we can compile the STG language to C, we must give it a semantics. Unlike other machines, whose programs are sequences of instructions, programs for the Spineless Tagless G-Machine are written directly in the STG language -- a functional language. \\

In this exercise, we will attach an operational semantics to the STG language and construct an interpreter for it.

\section*{Exercises}

\begin{questions}
    \question In computer science, we typically view functions as abstractions over expressions, which can be reduced to some value once all parameters have been substituted for arguments. In the context of programming languages, we say that the function \emph{returns} a value because it is passed to the calling function. For example, consider the following function which computes the $n$th fibonacci number:
    \begin{displaymath}
    \begin{array}{c|c}
    \textbf{OCaml} & \textbf{Haskell} \\ \hline
    \begin{array}{l}
    \mathbf{let}~\mathbf{rec}~\mathit{fib}~n = \\
    \quad \mathbf{if}~n=0 \\
    \quad \mathbf{then}~0 \\
    \quad \mathbf{else}~\mathbf{if}~n=1 \\
    \qquad \mathbf{then}~1 \\
    \qquad \mathbf{else}~\mathit{fib}(n-1) + \mathit{fib}(n-2)
    \end{array} &
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    \mathit{fib} & :: & \mathit{Int} \to \mathit{Int} \\
    \mathit{fib}~0 & = & 0 \\
    \mathit{fib}~1 & = & 1 \\
    \mathit{fib}~n & = & \mathit{fib}~(n-1) + \mathit{fib}~(n-2)
    \end{array}
    \end{array}
    \end{displaymath}
    If we apply $\mathit{fib}$ to an integer, then it will return the corresponding number in the fibonacci sequence to the calling function. However, this is not the only way in which we can construct functions.
    
    Another approach is to write functions which \emph{never} return. Instead, they are higher-order functions which take one or more \emph{continuations} as arguments. A continuation is a function which takes the result of another function as argument and which is called when that function has finished computing its result. For example, a modified version of $\mathit{fib}$ in \emph{Continuation-Passing Style} (CPS) is:
    \begin{displaymath}
    \begin{array}{l|l}
    \textbf{OCaml} & \begin{array}{l}
    \mathbf{let}~\mathbf{rec}~\mathit{fib\_cps}~(n,k) = \\
    \quad \mathbf{if}~n=0 \\
    \quad \mathbf{then}~k~0 \\
    \quad \mathbf{else}~\mathbf{if}~n=1 \\
    \qquad \mathbf{then}~k~1 \\
    \qquad \mathbf{else}~\mathit{fib}\_cps(n-1, \lambda a \to \mathit{fib\_cps}(n-2, \lambda b \to k~(a+b))) 
    \end{array} \\ \hline 
    \textbf{Haskell} & \begin{array}{lcl}
    \mathit{fib\_cps} & :: & \mathit{Int} \to (\mathit{Int} \to a) \to a \\
    \mathit{fib\_cps}~0~k & = & k~0 \\
    \mathit{fib\_cps}~1~k & = & k~1 \\
    \mathit{fib\_cps}~n~k & = & \mathit{fib\_cps}~(n-1)~(\lambda a \to \mathit{fib\_cps}~(n-2)~(\lambda b \to k~(a+b))) 
    \end{array}
    \end{array}
    \end{displaymath}
    Instead of returning the $n$th number in the fibonacci sequence like $\mathit{fib}$ did, $\mathit{fib\_cps}$ calls $k$ with the corresponding fibonacci number instead. 
    \begin{parts}
        
        \part Convert the following definition of a function which computes the greatest common divider into Continuation-Passing Style:
        \begin{displaymath}
        \begin{array}{c|c}
        \textbf{OCaml} & \textbf{Haskell} \\ \hline
        \begin{array}{l}
        \mathbf{let}~\mathbf{rec}~\mathit{gcd}~(m,n) = \\
        \quad \mathbf{if}~m=n \\
        \quad \mathbf{then}~m \\
        \quad \mathbf{else}~\mathbf{if}~m<n \\
        \qquad \mathbf{then}~\mathit{gcd}(m,n-m) \\
        \qquad \mathbf{else}~\mathit{gcd}(m-n,n)
        \end{array} & \begin{array}{lcl}
        \mathit{gcd} & :: & \mathit{Int} \to \mathit{Int} \to \mathit{Int} \\
        \mathit{gcd}~m~n \\
        \multicolumn{3}{l}{\quad \begin{array}{clcl}
            \mid & m == n & = & m \\
            \mid & m < n & = & \mathit{gcd}~m~(n-m) \\
            \mid & \mathit{otherwise} & = & \mathit{gcd}~(m-n)~n
            \end{array}}
        \end{array}
        \end{array}
        \end{displaymath}
        
        \part Compare the definitions of $\mathit{fib}$ and $\mathit{fib\_cps}$. Can you identify a property of functions in programming which $\mathit{fib\_cps}$ has, but $\mathit{fib}$ does not? Do $\mathit{gcd}$ or $\mathit{gcd\_cps}$ have the same property? What might this suggest about Continuation-Passing Style?
        
        %\part Consider the problem of compiling a program in CPS to the instruction set for a typical computer
        
    \end{parts}
    
    \question $\lambda$-forms, $\mathit{vs}~\terminal{\textbackslash}\pi~\mathit{xs}~\terminal{->}~\mathit{e}$, in the STG language (\autoref{fig:stglang}) contain two sets of variables: the set of free variables in $e$, $\mathit{vs}$, and the set of variables which are bound by this $\lambda$-form, $\mathit{xs}$.
        
    The variables of a $\lambda$-form are free if:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item they are mentioned in the body of the $\lambda$-form, $e$, and
        \item they are not bound by another $\lambda$-form or in the pattern of a case alternative, and
        \item they are not bound at the top level of the program, \emph{i.e.} they are not \emph{globals}
    \end{itemize}
    The first two cases are the usual ones for free variables in the $\lambda$-calculus, but note the unusual third case. For example, consider the following program in the STG language:
    \begin{verbatim}
g = {y,z} \n {f} -> case y {} of
    Nil {}      -> k { }
    Cons {x,xs} -> f { x, xs, z }
    
k = {} \u {} -> Nil { }
    \end{verbatim}
    In the definition of $g$, $y$ and $z$ are free because they are mentioned in the body of the $\lambda$-form, but are not bound anywhere, nor are they the names of global definitions. $k$ is bound because it is the name of a top-level definition. $x$ and $xs$ are bound by the case alternative, and $f$ is bound by the $\lambda$-form.
    
    Define a function, $\mathit{validateFVS}$, which validates that the variables listed in the set of free variables, $\mathit{vs}$, of an arbitrary $\lambda$-form are indeed free. This may be useful since the set $\mathit{vs}$ is part of the concrete syntax of the language, so it is worth checking whether the user has actually got this right when he or she wrote the program.
    
    \question Most abstract or virtual machines have a set of instructions which can be put in a sequence to construct a program. The Spineless Tagless G-Machine is different: it does not have such an instruction set. Instead, the STG language -- a functional programming language -- is the equivalent of an instruction set for the Spineless Tagless G-Machine. The operational semantics of the machine are attached directly to the STG language.
    
    \begin{parts}
    
        \part In imperative languages, functions are traditionally defined at only the top-level. Only their parameters, local variables, and global variables are in scope. In functional languages, on the other hand, anonymous functions may be defined within the scope of another function. These functions will \emph{capture} variables which are in the surrounding scope: \emph{i.e.} the captured variables may be used in the scope of the anonymous function.
        
        Using appropriate examples, discuss potential pitfalls when implementing a programming language which has anonymous functions. Can you propose a workaround?
        
        \part The semantics of the Spineless Tagless G-Machine are \emph{lazy}. In other words, it implements \emph{call-by-need} evaluation as well as \emph{sharing}. Call-by-need is an evaluation strategy which only evaluates a term when its value must be known to progress. Without knowing the exact semantics of the Spineless Tagless G-Machine, can you identify which type(s) of expression(s) in the STG language will likely not be able to progress without knowing the value of a sub-expression?
        
        \part The STG language is \emph{pure}. In other words, functions will always return the same result for a given set of arguments and they cannot have side-effects, such as outputting text to a terminal or writing data to a file. Consider the following program in the STG language:        
        \begin{verbatim}
foo = {} \n {xs,ys} -> let zs = {xs,ys} \u {} -> zip {xs,ys};
                       in concat {zs,zs}
        \end{verbatim}
        Because our evaluation strategy is call-by-need, \texttt{zs} will not be evaluated before being passed as an argument to the \texttt{concat} function. \texttt{concat} is of course unaware that is being given the same argument twice and we also do not want to evaluate \texttt{zs} twice, since it may be an arbitrarily complex expression and we know that the result must always be the same. This is where \emph{sharing} comes into play: if a $\lambda$-form is marked as updatable (\emph{i.e.} it has the \texttt{u} flag instead of the \texttt{n} flag), then the expression will be replaced with the value it evaluates to after that value has been computed for the first time.
        
        The update flag can safely be set for every $\lambda$-form in a program, but updates are computationally expensive, so we would like to avoid having to perform updates when possible, such as \emph{e.g.} when the expression of the $\lambda$-form is already a normal form. Can you identify general cases where it is not necessary to have have an updatable $\lambda$-form?
    \end{parts}
    \newpage
    \question A program in the STG language is just a collection of global bindings, referred to as \emph{globals}, and has the general form:
    \begin{displaymath}
    \begin{array}{lcl}
    g_1 & = & \mathit{vs}_1~\terminal{\textbackslash}\pi~\mathit{xs}_1~\terminal{->}~\mathit{e}_1 \\
    \ldots \\
    g_n & = & \mathit{vs}_n~\terminal{\textbackslash}\pi~\mathit{xs}_n~\terminal{->}~\mathit{e}_n \\
    \end{array}
    \end{displaymath}
    One of these globals must be $\terminal{main}$, which is the first function to be evaluated. For example, \autoref{fig:program} shows a simple program in the STG language.

\section*{Practical Exercises}

For the practical exercises, we will implement a compiler from the STG language (shown in \autoref{fig:stglang}) to C. You may use a programming language of your choice, but note that skeleton code is available in Haskell (and will save you much of the work). 

\begin{mdframed}
\textbf{Updating the Skeleton Code}\\
The skeleton code has been updated for this exercise. It is available as the \texttt{supervision2} branch on the \texttt{mbg/compconstr-code} repository. Note that the \texttt{supervision2} branch does not include any answers to the previous exercises. 

If you have forked the repository to your own GitHub account, you should first bring your fork up-to-date:
\begin{verbatim}
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/mbg/compconstr-code
$ git fetch upstream
\end{verbatim}
At this point, you should ensure that you are on your own \texttt{master} branch:
\begin{verbatim}
$ git checkout master
\end{verbatim}
Next, merge the (potentially) updated \texttt{upstream/master} branch into your own:
\begin{verbatim}
$ git merge upstream/master
\end{verbatim}
In theory, you should not encounter any merge errors at this point. If you do, you will have to fix and commit them before proceeding.

Next, you should merge the \texttt{upstream/supervision2} branch into your own:
\begin{verbatim}
$ git merge upstream/supervision2
\end{verbatim}
If you haven't created a fork and the \texttt{origin} remote is \texttt{https://github.com/mbg/compconstr-code}, then you should pull changes from there instead:
\begin{verbatim}
$ git pull
$ git merge superivison2
\end{verbatim}
Again, you should not encounter any merge errors, but if there are any, fix and commit them before proceeding. 

There is a new dependency, so you will need to install it:
\begin{verbatim}
$ cabal install --only-dependencies
$ cabal configure
\end{verbatim}
Once the new dependency has been installed, verify that the program compiles successfully (repeat this step whenever you wish to re-compile the compiler):
\begin{verbatim}
$ cabal build
\end{verbatim}
If successful, this should create an executable in the \texttt{./dist/build/stg/} directory. You can invoke the compiler with \emph{e.g.}, although note that this will fail with a parse error until you have completed the exercises below:
\begin{verbatim}
$ ./dist/build/stg/stg ./tests/Map.stg --entry=main
\end{verbatim} 
The compiler will attempt to parse all files specified as inputs to the program. If a file can be parsed, the generated abstract syntax tree will be pretty-printed to the standard output and then interpreted, starting from the global binding named \texttt{main} (or whatever is specified by the \texttt{--entry=BINDING} flag on the command-line, if present).

If an error occurs, that error will be displayed instead. In this case, the interpreter likely won't be able to do anything since there is no binding named \texttt{main} and will terminate with the \texttt{Can't reduce further.} message. Alternatively, if there is a binding named \texttt{main}, then the interpreter will likely crash with the \texttt{Prelude: undefined} message.
\end{mdframed}

\begin{questions}
%\question Abstract machines, typically have an instruction set over which the operational semantics are defined. Programs are sequences of instructions. In our case, the instruction set consists of only $\mathbf{PUSH}$ and $\mathbf{ADD}$. However, as we have noted above, compiling a functional language to such an instruction set is not straight-forward.

%The Spineless Tagless G-Machine\footnote{A full description of this machine may be found in \url{http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.53.3729&rep=rep1&type=pdf} which you may find useful. Only Part II is relevant to this exercise.} was designed as a target machine for non-strict, functional languages (primarily Haskell). Programs for the STG machine are written in the STG language which, unlike most other machine languages, is a functional language which is given an operational semantics. This makes it easy to translate more high-level functional languages into STG programs. Its syntax is shown in \autoref{fig:stglang}. We use a dark purple, italic font ($\mathit{symbol}$) to denote non-terminals, a light purple, typewriter font ($\terminal{terminal}$) to denote terminals, and a regular black font for everything else. Sequences are denoted using $\ldots$ and numbered symbols.

\question Extend your compiler with the $\mathit{validateFVS}$ function and use it to validate the abstract syntax tree of source files which have been parsed successfully.

\question Implement an interpreter for the STG language according to the specification of the operational semantics in Appendix \ref{app:semantics}. If you are using the skeleton code, a basic framework for the interpreter can be found in the \texttt{src/Interpreter.hs} file. In particular, you should replace all occurrences of $\mathit{undefined}$ with code of your own.

\begin{mdframed}
\textbf{Aside: Sequencing operations}\\
Note that the type of the $\mathit{step}$ function is $\mathit{Config} \to \mathit{Maybe}~\mathit{Config}$. In other words, the function takes a configuration as argument and either returns a new configuration wrapped in the $\mathit{Just}$ constructor or $\mathit{Nothing}$ to indicate failure. While it is useful to know that a function may fail, this may also be somewhat cumbersome. For example, consider using the $\mathit{val}$ function, which may fail if a variable can neither be found in the local nor the global environment, inside the definition of $\mathit{step}$. If we use $\mathit{val}$, we have to check if it was successful or not to determine whether we wish to proceed with the result or return failure ourselves. One such example might be the rule for built-in operators where we need to look up the values of the arguments before proceeding:
\begin{displaymath}
\begin{array}{l}
\mathit{step}~(\mathit{Eval}~(\mathit{OpE}~op~\hslist{x1,x2}~\_)~p,\mathit{as},\mathit{rs},\mathit{us},\mathit{h},\mathit{env}) = \\
\quad \mathbf{case}~\mathit{val}~p~\mathit{M.empty}~\mathit{x1}~\mathbf{of} \\
\qquad \begin{array}{lcl}
\mathit{Nothing} & \to & \mathit{Nothing} \\
\mathit{Just~i1} & \to & \mathbf{case}~\mathit{val}~p~\mathit{M.empty}~\mathit{x2}~\mathbf{of}
\end{array} \\
\qquad \qquad \begin{array}{lcl}
\mathit{Nothing} & \to & \mathit{Nothing} \\
\mathit{Just~i2} & \to & \mathit{Just}~(\ldots)
\end{array}
\end{array}
\end{displaymath}
This is of course extremely tedious, since we have to write the same test over and over again. Fortunately, there is some Haskell magic to help us out. It just so happens that the $\mathit{Maybe}$ type has a particular property which allows us to make use of a special syntax in Haskell: the $\mathbf{do}$-notation. Using this notation, the above code may be rewritten as:
\begin{displaymath}
\begin{array}{l}
\mathit{step}~(\mathit{Eval}~(\mathit{OpE}~op~\hslist{x1,x2}~\_)~p,\mathit{as},\mathit{rs},\mathit{us},\mathit{h},\mathit{env}) = \mathbf{do} \\
\quad \begin{array}{lcl}
\mathit{i1} & \leftarrow & \mathit{val}~p~\mathit{M.empty}~\mathit{x1} \\
\mathit{i2} & \leftarrow & \mathit{val}~p~\mathit{M.empty}~\mathit{x2} \\
\mathit{Just}~(\ldots)
\end{array}
\end{array}
\end{displaymath}
The $\mathbf{do}$ keyword is followed by a sequence of statements, which come in two forms. A statement of form $x \leftarrow m$ where $m :: \mathit{Maybe}~a$ and $x :: a$ (for some type $a$) binds $x$ in subsequent statements by evaluating $m$ and automagically performing the test shown above, extracting the value of type $a$ from the value of type $\mathit{Maybe}~a$ if successful. A statement of form $m$ where $m :: \mathit{Maybe}~a$ can also be used. If it occurs as the last statement in a $\mathbf{do}$-block, then it is used as the value of the $\mathit{do}$-block (but note that the $a$ must then match the expected type of the whole block). Otherwise, $m$ is evaluated and its result is used to perform the above test, but the result is then discarded and not bound to a variable.

\textbf{Aside: Useful functions and types}\\
If you are using the skeleton code, you may find the following functions and types useful. In particular, the $\mathit{Interpreter}$ module makes use of the $\mathit{Data.Map}$ module from the \texttt{containers} package, which implements dictionaries. The full documentation for this module may be found at

\url{https://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers-0.5.7.1/docs/Data-Map-Lazy.html}

but is imported as qualified and all function and type names are prefixed with $M.$ as a result. In particular, note that $\mathbf{type}~\mathit{GlEnv} = \mathit{M.Map}~\mathit{String}~\mathit{Addr}$ and $\mathbf{type}~\mathit{Heap} = \mathit{M.Map}~\mathit{Addr}~\mathit{Closure}$.

\begin{mdframed}
\begin{displaymath}
\mathit{M.empty} :: \mathit{M.Map}~k~a
\end{displaymath}
$\mathit{M.empty}$ represents an empty dictionary.
\end{mdframed}

\begin{mdframed}
\begin{displaymath}
\mathit{M.size} :: \mathit{M.Map}~k~a \to \mathit{Int}
\end{displaymath}
$\mathit{M.size}~\mathit{dict}$ returns the number of entries in $\mathit{dict}$. $\mathcal{O}(1)$.
\end{mdframed}

\begin{mdframed}
\begin{displaymath}
\mathit{M.fromList} :: \mathit{Ord}~k \Rightarrow \hslist{(k, a)} \to \mathit{M.Map}~k~a 
\end{displaymath}
$\mathit{M.fromList}~\mathit{xs}$ converts a list of pairs to a dictionary. $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$.
\end{mdframed}

\begin{mdframed}
\begin{displaymath}
\mathit{M.insert} :: \mathit{Ord}~k \Rightarrow k \to a \to \mathit{M.Map}~k~a \to \mathit{M.Map}~k~a
\end{displaymath}
$\mathit{M.insert}~\mathit{key}~\mathit{val}~\mathit{dict}$ inserts a value $\mathit{val}$ with key $\mathit{key}$ into the dictionary $\mathit{dict}$. $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$.
\end{mdframed}

\begin{mdframed}
\begin{displaymath}
\mathit{M.union} :: \mathit{Ord}~k \Rightarrow \mathit{M.Map}~k~a \to \mathit{M.Map}~k~a \to \mathit{M.Map}~k~a
\end{displaymath}
$\mathit{M.union}~\mathit{d1}~\mathit{d2}$ calculates the left-biased union of $\mathit{d1}$ and $\mathit{d2}$. \emph{I.e.} it prefers $\mathit{d1}$ when duplicate keys are encountered. $\mathcal{O}(n + m)$.
\end{mdframed}

\begin{mdframed}
\begin{displaymath}
\mathit{M.lookup} :: \mathit{Ord}~k \Rightarrow k \to \mathit{M.Map}~k~a \to \mathit{Maybe}~a
\end{displaymath}
$\mathit{M.lookup}~\mathit{key}~\mathit{dict}$ looks up $\mathit{key}$ in $\mathit{dict}$. $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$.
\end{mdframed}

You may also find the following function useful:

\begin{mdframed}
\begin{displaymath}
\mathit{mapM} :: (a \to \mathit{Maybe}~b) \to \hslist{a} \to \mathit{Maybe}~\hslist{b}
\end{displaymath}
$\mathit{mapM}~f~\mathit{xs}$ applies $f$ to every element in $\mathit{xs}$, but checks that $f$ was successful before proceeding to the next element. In other words, if $f$ fails for at least one element in $\mathit{xs}$, then $\mathit{mapM}$ also fails.
\end{mdframed}

Documentation for functions which deal with lists in Haskell may be found at:

\url{http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.8.2.0/docs/Data-List.html}

Another useful resource is Hoogle, which you can use to search for things by name or type:

\url{https://www.haskell.org/hoogle/}

For example, if you wanted to find a function which returns the size of a list, but don't know its name, you could search for \texttt{[a] -> Int}.

\question Thoroughly test your interpreter to ensure that all rules in the operational semantics have been implemented correctly, according to the specification in Appendix \ref{app:semantics}. Explain how you have tested your interpreter and why you are convinced that it is correct.
